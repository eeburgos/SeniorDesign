While working with databases there might be times when you would want to add a new record to the table, perhaps a new customer needs to be added to the table. There might be times when you might been to update an existing record on the table, perhaps a customer now has a new phone number.

With the tutorial below explain how to add a new record to an existing table as well as update values for a certain record.

## Adding a new record
Suppose you have the table of "Customer_Info" below

| Customer_Name | Customer_Phone | Customer_Zip_Code |
| Edwin Burgos	| 1213456789	   | 81932			       |

If you we asked to add a new record you could use the following format

INSERT INTO [Table_Name]
(Field1, Field2, Field3, ...)
VALUES (Value1,Value2, Value3, ...)

Following this format will allow you to fill in the appropraite fields and values then add them to the table. So if you were looking to add a new customer to the Customer_Info table you would use something like:

INSERT INTO [Table_Name]
(Customer_Name, Customer_Phone, Customer_Zip_Code)
VALUES ('Steph Morales', 1182345725, 83920)

And this results in

| Customer_Name | Customer_Phone | Customer_Zip_Code |
| Edwin Burgos	| 1213456789	   | 81932			       |
| Steph Morales	| 1182345725	   | 83920	           |


## Updating an existing record
Using the table from before, supposed you needed to update the phone number for an exiting customer.

To do this you would follow the format below:

UPDATE [Table_Name]
SET Field2 = Value2, Field3 = Value3
WHERE Field1 = [Unique_Value]

So to update a record on our table, you would use:

UPDATE Customer_Info
SET Customer_Phone = 7896541234, Customer_Zip_Code = 78945
WHERE Customer_Name = 'Steph Morales'

This will give you the following table:

| Customer_Name | Customer_Phone | Customer_Zip_Code |
| Edwin Burgos	| 1213456789	   | 81932			       |
| Steph Morales	| 7896541234	   | 78945			       |
