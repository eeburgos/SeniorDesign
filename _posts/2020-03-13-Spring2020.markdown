# Hyperlinks
Adding a link to a page using Markdown can be done 2 different ways. The first and simplest way is by using enclosing the entire URL between angle brackets. `<>`

        <https://www.csun.edu>

This will produce a link with no title. Like the link below
<https://www.csun.edu>

This method also works for creating links to email addresses.

        <yourname@email.com>

This produces
<yourname@email.com>


The second method allows you to use a title for the link. For example, if you wanted to have the word "CSUN" be the link that is clickable.

      This is a link to [CSUN](https://www.csun.edu)

Was stated before this will make the link from what ever string you want. As so
This is a link to [CSUN](https://www.csun.edu)


The last attribute that can be implemented when creating links, is creating a  title to be displayed when you hover over a link.

        This is a link to [CSUN](https://www.csun.edu "My future alma mater")

This will give the link a title to give more description of the link.
This is a link to [CSUN](https://www.csun.edu "My future alma mater")
