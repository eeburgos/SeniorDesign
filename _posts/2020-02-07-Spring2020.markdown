Running queries with SQL can be very simple and straight forward when only pulling data from one single table. The typical structure for SQL queries is as follows



Select    [Fields],

          [Fields]



FROM   [Table]



WHERE [Criteria]



For this example, you would be working with a table such as this



OrderID    | OrderDate

1234       | 2/7/2020

5678       | 1/8/2020

1345       | 1/25/2020

3749       | 2/7/2020

5678       | 1/30/2020

3834       | 2/7/2020

1839       | 1/14/2020

5678       | 1/7/2020

1728       | 2/7/2020

1929       | 2/2/2020

5678       | 2/3/2020

2762       | 1/13/2020



But 9 times out of 10, you will be asked to pull data from more than one table. In a relational database, tables have relationships with other tables. A table could be connected to one, two tables or ten.



For example if you had the following tables



OrderID | CustomerID    | OrderDate      

1234    | 0001          | 2/7/2020

5678    | 0001          | 1/8/2020

1345    | 0023          | 1/25/2020

3749    | 0045          | 2/7/2020

5678    | 0067          | 1/30/2020

3834    | 0012          | 2/7/2020

1839    | 0001          | 1/14/2020

5678    | 0034          | 1/7/2020

1728    | 0023          | 2/7/2020

1929    | 0045          | 2/2/2020

5678    | 0076          | 2/3/2020

2762    | 0098          | 1/13/2020



CustomerID        | CustomerFirstName    | CustomerLastName

0001              | Edwin                | Burgos

0002              | Eric                 | Johnson

0023              | Linda                | Stone

0045              | Jon                  | Jacobs

0067              | Stephanie            | Morales

0012              | Alex                 | Gomez

0034              | Lisa                 | Smith

0023              | Nick                 | Yu

0076              | Emma                 | Jenkins

0098              | Jorge                | Alveraz



If you had these tables and were tasked to pull a table with the OrderID, the name of the Customer and the OrderDate you would need data from both of the tables. In SQL, you have the ability to combine multiple tables based on a related field, this method is known and JOIN.



To perform a JOIN, the tables you wish to combine need to share a common field, a field that is in both tables. In this case, both tables have CustomerID field so this will be out common field. For our example we will be using an Inner Join, which combines the records that are common in BOTH tables. You can think of it as a venn diagram, the records pulled will be those in the middle.



The structure for a JOIN query is similar to a normal query but with in an include JOIN statement after the FROM statement.





Select    [Table1].[Field1],

          [Table2].[Field2]



FROM   [Table1]



INNER JOIN [Table2] ON [Table2].[CommonField2] = [Table1].[CommonField1]



So with our identified common field we can create our query.



Select    Orders.OrderID,

          Customers.CustomerFirstName,

          Customers.CustomerLastName,

          Orders.OrderDate



FROM   Orders



INNER JOIN Customers ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID

WHERE Customers.CustomerLastName = 'Burgos'





This will produce the following results

OrderID | CustomerFirstName | CustomerLastName  | OrderDate      

1234    | Edwin             | Burgos            | 2/7/2020

5678    | Edwin             | Burgos            | 1/8/2020

1839    | Edwin             | Burgos            | 1/14/2020
